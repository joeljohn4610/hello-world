# hello-world
Store ideas, resources, and ideas.

My name is Joel Johnson, some people call me "JJ".  I am a AEC (Architectural, Engineering, Construction) consultant.
I am on a journey learning python for big data visualization, but with a first specific step of being the python
script master in a visual programming gui called Dynamo (for revit).  As new tech finally permeates this industry,
there are amazing things happening and coming, and I want in!
